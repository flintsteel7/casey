# Casey

**An Elixir string case converter**

Converts input string capitalization. The options are:
- all uppercase
- all lowercase
- title case
- capitalize words
- capitalize sentences
- capitalize lines

## Installation

Once I've finished, and Casey is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `casey` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:casey, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
